# Software_Engineering_Project


This application, developed using Python, allows the university dispensary to capture data regarding the attendance of currently registered students when they visit the clinic for medical attention. It takes into consideration the concerns mentioned and aims to provide an efficient and convenient solution for tracking student visits.

## Features

- **Student Authentication:** The application ensures that only currently registered students can access and use the attendance tracking system. Students are required to authenticate themselves using their unique credentials (e.g., student ID and password) before using the system.

- **Attendance Logging:** Once authenticated, students can log their visits to the clinic by providing relevant information such as the date, time, and reason for their visit. The application records this data for further analysis.

- **Privacy and Confidentiality:** The attendance tracker respects student privacy and ensures the confidentiality of their medical information. The application adheres to applicable privacy laws and regulations, storing data securely and only allowing authorized personnel to access it.

- **Reporting and Analytics:** The captured attendance data can be utilized to generate reports and perform analytics. This helps the university dispensary gain insights into student attendance patterns, common medical issues, and resource allocation optimization.
